Hi!
I'm sorry, it's my first time here and i don't know how all this works, so i'm sorry if something is wrong, i've some issues in Roll20 with Better20 5etools.
i've clicked on "report" and brought me here, i've used ctrl+shift+j to check the log and this is what i found. 
Thank you for your time, hope to not cause problems.
